**Estimated Duration**: 3 hours  
**Status**: Ready for execution  
**Dependencies**: ✅ DEV-001 (Development environment complete)

---

## 🎯 **Project Vision & Goals**

### **What We're Building**
We're creating the first mobile application in our three-app grocery delivery ecosystem: the **Customer Mobile App**. This app will serve as the primary interface for customers to browse products, manage their shopping cart, place orders, and track deliveries.

### **Strategic Importance**
This is the foundation application that will:
- Establish our mobile development patterns and standards
- Integrate with our newly deployed Vercel API backend
- Connect to our Supabase database for data persistence
- Serve as a template for the Admin and Delivery apps
- Demonstrate the complete end-to-end architecture working together

### **Architecture Philosophy**
We're implementing **Clean Architecture with MVVM pattern** because:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a single responsibility
- **Testability**: Business logic can be tested independently of UI/framework
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports growing complexity
- **Team Collaboration**: Clear boundaries allow parallel development

## 🏗️ **Detailed Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Project Foundation (45 minutes)**

**Approach**: Start with a solid foundation that incorporates all our established team standards from DEV-001-T2.

**What We'll Do:**
1. **Create Android Studio Project** using the Empty Activity template
2. **Apply Team Standards** by copying `.editorconfig`, `ktlint.yml`, and `detekt.yml` from our established standards
3. **Configure Build System** with all necessary plugins and code quality tools
4. **Set Up Git Integration** following our GitFlow branching strategy

**Why This Matters**: By applying our standards from day one, we ensure consistency across the entire codebase and avoid technical debt later.

### **Phase 2: Clean Architecture Package Structure (30 minutes)**

**Approach**: Implement a package structure that clearly separates concerns and follows Clean Architecture principles.

**Package Organization Strategy**:
```
com.grocerysystem.customer/
├── ui/                     # Presentation Layer
│   ├── activities/         # Android Activities
│   ├── fragments/          # UI Fragments  
│   ├── adapters/           # RecyclerView Adapters
│   ├── viewmodels/         # ViewModels (Presentation Logic)
│   └── theme/              # UI Theming and Styles
├── data/                   # Data Layer
│   ├── repositories/       # Repository Implementations
│   ├── datasources/        # Remote and Local Data Sources
│   ├── models/             # Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
│   ├── network/            # API Interfaces and Network Configuration
│   └── database/           # Room Database Entities and DAOs
├── domain/                 # Business Logic Layer
│   ├── usecases/           # Business Use Cases
│   ├── entities/           # Domain Business Entities
│   └── repositories/       # Repository Interface Contracts
├── di/                     # Dependency Injection Modules
└── utils/                  # Utility Classes and Extensions
```

**Natural Language Explanation**: 
Think of this structure like organizing a physical store. The **UI layer** is the storefront that customers see and interact with. The **data layer** is like the warehouse and supply chain that handles getting products and storing information. The **domain layer** is the business logic - the rules about how the store operates, pricing, inventory management, etc. The **DI folder** is like the management system that makes sure every department gets the resources it needs to function.

### **Phase 3: Dependencies & Integration Setup (45 minutes)**

**Approach**: Carefully select and configure libraries that integrate well together and support our architecture goals.

**Core Dependencies Strategy**:

**Android Essentials**:
- **AndroidX Core**: Modern Android APIs and backward compatibility
- **Material Design**: Google's design system for consistent UI
- **ConstraintLayout**: Flexible layout system for complex UIs

**Architecture Components**:
- **ViewModel & LiveData**: Reactive data binding between UI and business logic
- **Navigation Component**: Type-safe navigation between screens
- **Room Database**: SQLite wrapper for local data persistence

**Networking & Backend Integration**:
- **Retrofit**: Type-safe HTTP client for API communication
- **OkHttp**: Network layer with logging and interceptors
- **Gson**: JSON serialization for API data transfer

**Dependency Injection**:
- **Hilt**: Compile-time dependency injection built on Dagger

**Natural Language Explanation**: 
These dependencies are like specialized tools in a craftsman's workshop. Retrofit is our communication system to talk to the Vercel API we built. Room is our local filing system to store data when offline. Hilt is our organizational system that makes sure every part of the app gets what it needs to work. Each tool is chosen because it works well with the others and follows Android best practices.

### **Phase 4: Base Architecture Implementation (45 minutes)**

**Approach**: Create foundational classes that will be extended throughout the app, ensuring consistency and reducing boilerplate code.

**Base Classes We'll Create**:

1. **BaseActivity**: Common functionality for all activities (loading states, error handling)
2. **BaseFragment**: Shared fragment behavior (lifecycle management, navigation)  
3. **BaseViewModel**: Common ViewModel features (loading states, error handling)
4. **BaseRepository**: Repository pattern implementation with error handling

**Integration Setup**:
- **Hilt Application Class**: Central dependency injection configuration
- **Network Module**: Retrofit configuration with our Vercel API endpoints
- **Database Module**: Room database configuration for offline storage
- **Repository Bindings**: Connecting interface contracts to implementations

**Natural Language Explanation**:
Base classes are like templates or blueprints that define common behavior. Think of them as the "standard operating procedures" that every screen or data handler in our app follows. This ensures that whether you're looking at the product catalog, user profile, or shopping cart, they all handle loading, errors, and navigation in the same predictable way.

### **Phase 5: Verification & Integration Testing (15 minutes)**

**Approach**: Ensure everything works together before moving to feature development.

**Testing Strategy**:
1. **Build Verification**: Ensure project compiles without errors
2. **Runtime Testing**: Launch app on emulator to verify basic functionality
3. **Code Quality Verification**: Run ktlint and detekt to ensure standards compliance
4. **Dependency Injection Testing**: Verify Hilt modules work correctly
5. **Git Integration**: Commit initial structure following team standards

## 🚀 **Development Philosophy & Approach**

### **Quality-First Mindset**
We're not just creating a basic Android project - we're establishing the foundation for a production-ready mobile application. Every decision is made with long-term maintainability, scalability, and team collaboration in mind.

### **Integration-Aware Development**
Since we've already established our backend infrastructure (Supabase + Vercel), this mobile app is designed from the ground up to integrate seamlessly with our existing systems. We're not building in isolation - we're completing the full-stack architecture.

### **Standards-Driven Implementation**
All the work we did in DEV-001-T2 establishing team development standards pays off here. We're not guessing about code formatting, naming conventions, or project structure - we're following our established patterns that the entire team agreed upon.

### **Template-Oriented Architecture**
While we're building the customer app, we're also creating the blueprint for the admin and delivery apps. This means making thoughtful architecture decisions that will work across all three applications while allowing for app-specific customizations.

### **Future-Proof Foundation**
The architecture we're implementing can scale from a simple product catalog to a complex e-commerce platform with real-time features, offline support, push notifications, and advanced analytics. We're building for tomorrow's requirements, not just today's.
