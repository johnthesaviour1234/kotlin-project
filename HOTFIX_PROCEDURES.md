# Hotfix Procedures

**Branch**: hotfix/critical-fix  
**Source**: main (production)  
**Target**: main (production) + develop  
**Priority**: Critical - Immediate deployment required  

## üö® Hotfix Process Overview

Hotfixes are used for critical production issues that require immediate fixes without waiting for the regular release cycle.

## üî• When to Use Hotfix Branches

### Critical Issues Requiring Hotfix:
- [ ] **Security vulnerabilities** in production
- [ ] **Data integrity issues** or data loss
- [ ] **Complete service outages** or API failures
- [ ] **Authentication/authorization failures**
- [ ] **Payment processing failures**
- [ ] **Critical mobile app crashes** affecting all users

### Issues that DON'T require hotfix:
- [ ] Minor UI issues or cosmetic bugs
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Feature enhancements
- [ ] Non-critical logging or monitoring issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Hotfix Workflow

### 1. Create Hotfix Branch
```bash
# Branch from main (production)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/security-vulnerability-fix
```

### 2. Fix the Issue
```bash
# Make minimal changes to fix the critical issue
# Focus only on the immediate problem
# Avoid scope creep or additional features
```

### 3. Test the Fix
```bash
# Run automated tests
# Manual testing of the specific issue
# Verify no regressions introduced
# Security scanning if applicable
```

### 4. Deploy to Main (Production)
```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/security-vulnerability-fix
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Hotfix version 1.0.1 - Security vulnerability fix"
git push origin main --tags
```

### 5. Merge to Develop
```bash
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/security-vulnerability-fix
git push origin develop
```

### 6. Cleanup
```bash
git branch -d hotfix/security-vulnerability-fix
git push origin --delete hotfix/security-vulnerability-fix
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Hotfix Timeline

- **Discovery to Branch Creation**: < 30 minutes
- **Fix Implementation**: < 2 hours
- **Testing and Validation**: < 1 hour
- **Deployment to Production**: < 30 minutes
- **Total Resolution Time**: < 4 hours

## üìã Hotfix Checklist

### Pre-Fix Assessment
- [ ] Confirm issue is production-critical
- [ ] Identify root cause and scope of impact
- [ ] Determine minimal fix required
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of hotfix process

### Implementation
- [ ] Create hotfix branch from main
- [ ] Implement minimal fix only
- [ ] Add/update tests for the fix
- [ ] Verify fix resolves the issue

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Manual testing of critical paths
- [ ] Security scan (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance impact assessment

### Deployment
- [ ] Merge to main with --no-ff
- [ ] Tag with patch version (v1.0.1, v1.0.2, etc.)
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Verify fix in production
- [ ] Merge back to develop

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor production for issues
- [ ] Update incident documentation
- [ ] Conduct post-mortem analysis
- [ ] Update processes to prevent recurrence

## üö® Emergency Contacts
