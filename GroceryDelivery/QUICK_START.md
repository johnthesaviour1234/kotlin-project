# üöÄ Quick Start - GroceryDelivery Real-Time Sync

## What's Been Done

‚úÖ **Real-time sync is now implemented!** The GroceryDelivery app will automatically receive order assignments and status updates without manual refresh.

## üì¶ What You Need to Build

Before running the app, you need to sync the Gradle project:

```bash
cd GroceryDelivery
./gradlew build
```

This will download the newly added Supabase dependencies.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Test (1 minute)

### Option A: Using ADB and SQL
1. Install and run the GroceryDelivery app
2. Login as a delivery person
3. Open logcat:
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep "RealtimeManager\|AvailableOrdersViewModel"
   ```
4. From Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor, run:
   ```sql
   -- Get a test driver ID (replace with real logged-in user)
   SELECT id FROM user_profiles WHERE role = 'delivery_person' LIMIT 1;
   
   -- Create test order (replace YOUR_DRIVER_ID)
   INSERT INTO delivery_assignments (order_id, delivery_person_id, status)
   SELECT 
       (SELECT id FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending' LIMIT 1),
       'YOUR_DRIVER_ID',
       'pending';
   ```
5. **Watch the app** - The new order should appear within 2 seconds!

### Option B: Using Admin App (When Available)
1. Run GroceryDelivery app and login
2. Run GroceryAdmin app and login as admin
3. Assign an order to the delivery person from Admin app
4. Watch the order appear instantly in Delivery app

## üìã Verify It's Working

Look for these logs:
```
RealtimeManager: Connecting to realtime channel for driver: [ID]
RealtimeManager: Successfully connected to realtime channel
MainActivity: Realtime connected
```

When an order is assigned:
```
RealtimeManager: Received order_assigned event
RealtimeManager: Order assigned: [ORDER_NUMBER]
AvailableOrdersViewModel: New order assigned: [ORDER_NUMBER]
```

## üêõ If Something Goes Wrong

### App Won't Build
```bash
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build --refresh-dependencies
```

### Can't Connect to Realtime
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Supabase credentials in `build.gradle.kts`
3. Check logcat for error messages

### Events Not Received
1. Verify you're logged in
2. Check database triggers exist (see REALTIME_TESTING_GUIDE.md)
3. Ensure Realtime is enabled in Supabase Dashboard

- **Implementation Details:** `REALTIME_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Architecture & code
- **Migration Plan:** `../REALTIME_SYNC_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Overall strategy

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation** using REALTIME_TESTING_GUIDE.md
2. **Deploy backend triggers** (if not already done)
3. **Implement for Customer app** (Phase 2)
4. **Implement for Admin app** (Phase 3)

## üîß Rollback (If Needed)

If realtime causes issues, quickly disable it:

**File:** `MainActivity.kt`
```kotlin
override fun setupUI() {
    setupToolbar()
    setupRecyclerView()
    setupSwipeRefresh()
    setupBottomNavigation()
    // setupRealtimeConnection() // ‚Üê Comment this line
}
```

## üí° Pro Tips

- Keep logcat open during testing for instant feedback
- Test with multiple devices to see multi-driver filtering
- Try airplane mode to test reconnection
- Background the app to verify persistent connection
