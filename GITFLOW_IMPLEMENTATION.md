# GitFlow Implementation Status

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE**  
**Branch**: feature/backend/api-deployment  

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Summary

This document records the successful implementation of proper GitFlow branching strategy according to our established [GIT_WORKFLOW.md](GIT_WORKFLOW.md) documentation.

### âœ… Completed Actions

1. **Branch Structure Corrected**
   - Moved work from direct `main` commits to proper feature branch
   - Updated `develop` branch with latest changes
   - Created `feature/backend/api-deployment` for current work

2. **Vercel Integration Verified**
   - `main` branch triggers production deployments
   - `develop` branch triggers staging deployments
   - Feature branches trigger preview deployments

3. **API Deployment Status**
   - Health endpoint operational: `/api/health`
   - Authentication endpoints ready: `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`
   - Environment variables configured properly
