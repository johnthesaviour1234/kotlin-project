# Phase 3: Real Status and Action Plan
## What's Actually Done vs. What Needs to Be Done

**Date**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Only Cart Complete)

---

## ✅ What's ACTUALLY Complete

### Cart Feature ONLY (GroceryCustomer App)

**Completed Features**:
- ✅ Add item to cart → real-time sync across devices
- ✅ Update item quantity → real-time sync across devices
- ✅ Remove item from cart → real-time sync across devices
- ✅ Clear cart → real-time sync across devices

**What Works**:
```
Phone A (abcd@gmail.com):
1. Add "Apple" to cart
   ↓
Phone B (abcd@gmail.com):
2. Cart badge updates from 0 → 1 (INSTANTLY)
3. Cart page shows "Apple" (INSTANTLY)
4. No manual refresh needed! ✨
```

**Known Limitation**:
- Events can be missed during WebSocket disconnections
- Vercel serverless prevents persistent event queues
- User needs to refresh manually if event was missed

**Files Completed**:
- ✅ `grocery-delivery-api/lib/eventBroadcaster.js` - Basic structure
- ✅ `grocery-delivery-api/pages/api/cart/index.js` - Broadcasts cart events
- ✅ `grocery-delivery-api/pages/api/cart/[productId].js` - Broadcasts quantity/remove events
- ✅ `GroceryCustomer/app/.../data/local/Event.kt` - Cart event types only
- ✅ `GroceryCustomer/app/.../data/local/EventBus.kt` - Generic event bus
- ✅ `GroceryCustomer/app/.../data/remote/RealtimeManager.kt` - Cart subscription only
- ✅ `GroceryCustomer/app/.../ui/viewmodels/CartViewModel.kt` - Subscribes to cart events

## 📋 Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Understand What You Have

**Read these files first**:
1. `EVENT_DRIVEN_ARCHITECTURE_SOP.md` (15 minutes)
   - All 6 mistakes we made and how we fixed them
   - Serialization requirements
   - Channel subscription patterns

2. `GroceryCustomer/app/.../data/remote/RealtimeManager.kt` (10 minutes)
   - See how cart subscription works (`subscribeToCartUpdates()`)
   - Copy this pattern for orders, products, etc.

3. `grocery-delivery-api/pages/api/cart/index.js` (5 minutes)
   - See how we broadcast cart events
   - Copy this pattern for orders, products

---

### Step 2: Start with Orders (Highest Value)

**Phase A: Backend Event Broadcasting (1-2 hours)**

1. **Add order events to EventBroadcaster**:
   ```javascript
   // grocery-delivery-api/lib/eventBroadcaster.js
   
   async orderCreated(orderId, userId, orderNumber, status, totalAmount) {
     await this.broadcastToChannel(`user:${userId}`, 'order_created', {
       order_id: orderId,
       order_number: orderNumber,
       status: status,
       total_amount: totalAmount
     })
   }
   
   async orderStatusChanged(orderId, userId, oldStatus, newStatus) {
     await this.broadcastToChannel(`user:${userId}`, 'order_status_changed', {
       order_id: orderId,
       old_status: oldStatus,
       new_status: newStatus
     })
   }
   ```

2. **Broadcast from order creation endpoint**:
   ```javascript
   // grocery-delivery-api/pages/api/orders/create.js
   
   // After order created successfully
   await eventBroadcaster.orderCreated(
     orderId,
     userId,
     orderNumber,
     'pending',
     totalAmount
   )
   ```

3. **Broadcast from status update endpoint**:
   ```javascript
   // grocery-delivery-api/pages/api/admin/orders/[id]/status.js
   
   // After status updated
   await eventBroadcaster.orderStatusChanged(
     id,
     order.user_id,
     order.status, // old status
     newStatus
   )
   ```

**Phase B: Android Event Subscription (2-3 hours)**

1. **Add order events to Event.kt**:
   ```kotlin
   // GroceryCustomer/app/.../data/local/Event.kt
   
   @Serializable
   data class OrderCreated(
       val orderId: String,
       val orderNumber: String,
       val status: String,
       val totalAmount: Double,
       val timestamp: String
   ) : Event()
   
   @Serializable
   data class OrderStatusChanged(
       val orderId: String,
       val oldStatus: String?,
       val newStatus: String,
       val timestamp: String
   ) : Event()
   ```

2. **Add payload class to RealtimeManager.kt**:
   ```kotlin
   @Serializable
   data class OrderStatusPayload(
       val order_id: String,
       val old_status: String?,
       val new_status: String,
       val timestamp: String?
   )
   ```

3. **Add subscription method to RealtimeManager.kt**:
   ```kotlin
   fun subscribeToOrder(orderId: String) {
       if (channels.containsKey("order:$orderId")) {
           Log.d(TAG, "Already subscribed to order:$orderId")
           return
       }
       
       scope.launch {
           try {
               val channel = supabaseClient.channel("order:$orderId")
               
               channel.on<OrderStatusPayload>("status_changed") { payload ->
                   Log.d(TAG, "Order status changed: $payload")
                   eventBus.publish(Event.OrderStatusChanged(
                       orderId = payload.order_id,
                       oldStatus = payload.old_status,
                       newStatus = payload.new_status,
                       timestamp = payload.timestamp ?: System.currentTimeMillis().toString()
                   ))
               }
               
               channel.subscribe()
               channels["order:$orderId"] = channel
               Log.d(TAG, "Subscribed to order:$orderId")
           } catch (e: Exception) {
               Log.e(TAG, "Failed to subscribe to order:$orderId", e)
           }
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Update OrderDetailViewModel** (if it exists, or create it):
   ```kotlin
   @HiltViewModel
   class OrderDetailViewModel @Inject constructor(
       private val ordersRepository: OrdersRepository,
       private val realtimeManager: RealtimeManager,
       private val eventBus: EventBus
   ) : BaseViewModel() {
       
       private val _order = MutableStateFlow<OrderDTO?>(null)
       val order: StateFlow<OrderDTO?> = _order.asStateFlow()
       
       init {
           // Subscribe to order status changes
           viewModelScope.launch {
               eventBus.events
                   .filterIsInstance<Event.OrderStatusChanged>()
                   .collect { event ->
                       if (event.orderId == _order.value?.id) {
                           Log.d(TAG, "Order status changed: ${event.newStatus}")
                           _order.value = _order.value?.copy(status = event.newStatus)
                       }
                   }
           }
       }
       
       fun loadOrder(orderId: String) {
           executeWithLoading {
               val order = ordersRepository.getOrder(orderId)
               _order.value = order
               
               // Subscribe to this order's updates
               realtimeManager.subscribeToOrder(orderId)
           }
       }
       
       override fun onCleared() {
           super.onCleared()
           _order.value?.id?.let { orderId ->
               realtimeManager.unsubscribe("order:$orderId")
           }
       }
   }
   ```

**Phase C: Test (30 minutes)**

1. Build and install on Phone A
2. Build and install on Phone B
3. Login with `abcd@gmail.com` on both
4. Place order from Phone A
5. Open order detail on Phone B
6. Update status from admin panel (or Postman)
7. Verify Phone B shows new status instantly
8. Check logcat for event flow

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### What to Do RIGHT NOW

1. **Read the SOP** (15 minutes):
   ```
   E:\warp projects\kotlin mobile application\EVENT_DRIVEN_ARCHITECTURE_SOP.md
   ```

2. **Check current RealtimeManager** (5 minutes):
   ```
   GroceryCustomer/app/src/main/java/com/grocery/customer/data/remote/RealtimeManager.kt
   ```
   - Look at `subscribeToCartUpdates()` function
   - This is your template for all other features

3. **Choose what to build first**:
   - Option A: Orders (most requested by users)
   - Option B: Products (prevents stock issues)
   - Option C: Admin dashboard (helps operations)

4. **Follow the 3-phase pattern** (from SOP):
   - Phase A: Backend broadcasts event
   - Phase B: Android subscribes and handles event
   - Phase C: Test with two devices
