### Phase 2: Problem Analysis & Root Cause Identification ✅ COMPLETE

**Issue Identified**: Order history card layout experiencing text overlapping on narrow screens

**Root Causes Documented**:
1. Constraint chain conflicts
   - Multiple 0dp width elements competing for space
   - Order number constrainted to status chip
   - Date constrained to price

2. Baseline alignment misalignment
   - Date and price using baseline constraints
   - Caused vertical misalignment and visual tension

3. Insufficient spacing
   - Only 8dp margins between critical elements
   - Accumulative crowding on narrow screens

4. Missing visual hierarchy
   - All elements on same logical level
   - No clear information zones
   - Flat, confusing structure

5. Lack of responsive design
   - No weight-based distribution
   - Hard-coded constraints
   - Poor behavior on <400dp width screens

**Visual Impact**:
- Price (₹522.50) overlapping status badge
- Unpredictable text wrapping
- Visual confusion due to lack of hierarchy
- Poor accessibility on small devices

**Root Cause**: The layout attempted to fit 4 pieces of information (Order #, Status, Date, Price) into 2 rows using competing horizontal constraints, which fundamentally cannot scale responsively.

---

### Phase 3: Solution Design ✅ COMPLETE

**Design Strategy**: Section-based layout with LinearLayout + nested ConstraintLayouts

**New Architecture**:
```
LinearLayout (vertical, 16dp padding)
├── Header Section (Order # + Status)
├── Details Section (Date + Price with labels)
├── Divider
└── Footer Section (Item count + Arrow)
```

**Key Technical Improvements**:

1. **Structural Reorganization**
   - Replaced flat ConstraintLayout with hierarchical LinearLayout
   - Created 3 functional zones (Header, Details, Footer)
   - Added Space elements for explicit spacing
   - Grouped related information (labels + values)

2. **Constraint Strategy**
   - Header: Uses Barrier constraint for guaranteed spacing
   - Details: Weight-based distribution (Date weight=1, Total wrap)
   - No competing 0dp widths
   - Responsive without conflicts

3. **Enhanced Spacing**
   - Card padding: 16dp (maintained)
   - Section gaps: 8dp → 12dp (50% increase)
   - Status margin: 8dp → 12dp
   - Explicit divider margins

4. **Improved Typography**
   - Added labels ("Order Date", "Total") for clarity
   - Font hierarchy: TitleMedium > TitleSmall > BodyMedium > BodySmall
   - Color coding: Primary for important info, Secondary for metadata
   - Muted labels (0.7 alpha) provide context without distraction

5. **Text Handling**
   - maxLines="1" on all text elements
   - ellipsize="end" for overflow handling
   - Prevents wrapping and overlapping

6. **Accessibility**
   - Arrow icon: 20x20dp → 24x24dp (better touch target)
   - Larger text, better contrast
   - Clear visual hierarchy guides attention
   - Color semantics: Status-specific coloring
