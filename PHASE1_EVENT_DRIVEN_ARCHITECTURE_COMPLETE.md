# Phase 1: Event-Driven Architecture - Backend Implementation Complete ✅

**Date**: January 29, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Time Taken**: ~2 hours  
**Phase**: Backend Infrastructure (3-5 days estimated → Completed in 2 hours)

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

Phase 1 of the Event-Driven Architecture refactoring has been successfully completed. The backend now has full support for real-time event broadcasting using Supabase Realtime channels. All critical API endpoints have been integrated with event broadcasting capabilities.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Event Broadcasting Module (`lib/eventBroadcaster.js`)

Created a comprehensive EventBroadcaster class that handles all real-time event broadcasting:

**Features**:
- ✅ Channel management (automatic channel creation and caching)
- ✅ Generic broadcast function for any channel/event combination
- ✅ Specialized high-level broadcast methods for common events
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Singleton pattern for global access

**Event Types Supported**:
- Order status changes
- New order creation
- Order assignment to drivers
- Product stock updates
- Low stock alerts
- Cart updates
- Driver location updates
- Delivery status updates
- Product CRUD operations

**Channel Structure**:
```
admin:orders         → All order-related admin events
admin:inventory      → Inventory alerts for admins
user:{userId}        → User-specific events (orders, cart)
cart:{userId}        → Cart updates per user
products             → Product stock/price changes
delivery:assignments → Delivery assignment events
driver:{driverId}    → Driver-specific events
order:{orderId}:tracking → Order tracking/location
```

### 2. API Endpoints Integrated

#### Order Management
✅ **Order Status Update** (`pages/api/admin/orders/[id]/status.js`)
- Broadcasts to: admin:orders, user:{userId}, delivery:assignments
- Notifies: Admins, specific customer, assigned driver

✅ **Order Creation** (`pages/api/orders/create.js`)
- Broadcasts to: admin:orders
- Notifies: All admins about new order

✅ **Order Assignment** (`pages/api/admin/orders/assign.js`)
- Broadcasts to: driver:{driverId}, user:{userId}, delivery:assignments
- Notifies: Assigned driver, customer, all delivery personnel

#### Inventory Management
✅ **Inventory Update** (`pages/api/admin/inventory/index.js`)
- Broadcasts to: products, admin:inventory (if low stock)
- Notifies: All users viewing products, admins if low stock
- Auto-detects low stock (threshold: 10) and sends alerts

#### Delivery Operations
✅ **Delivery Status Update** (`pages/api/delivery/update-status.js`)
- Broadcasts to: user:{userId}, admin:orders
- Notifies: Customer, admins

✅ **Driver Location Update** (`pages/api/delivery/update-location.js`)
- Broadcasts to: driver:{driverId}, order:{orderId}:tracking
- Notifies: Order tracking views with live location

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### EventBroadcaster API

```javascript
// Import
import eventBroadcaster from '../../../lib/eventBroadcaster.js'

// Order Status Changed
await eventBroadcaster.orderStatusChanged(orderId, newStatus, userId, deliveryPersonnelId)

// New Order Created
await eventBroadcaster.orderCreated(orderId, orderData)

// Order Assigned
await eventBroadcaster.orderAssigned(assignmentId, orderId, deliveryPersonnelId, userId)

// Product Stock Changed
await eventBroadcaster.productStockChanged(productId, newStock)

// Low Stock Alert
await eventBroadcaster.lowStockAlert(productId, stock, threshold)

// Cart Updated
await eventBroadcaster.cartUpdated(userId, cart)

// Driver Location Updated
await eventBroadcaster.driverLocationUpdated(driverId, latitude, longitude, orderId)

// Delivery Status Updated
await eventBroadcaster.deliveryStatusUpdated(assignmentId, status, orderId, userId)

// Product Changed (created/updated/deleted)
await eventBroadcaster.productChanged(action, productId, productData)
```

### Example: Order Status Update Flow

**Before (Request-Response only)**:
```
Admin updates status → Database updated → Response sent
Customer sees update: ❌ Only on manual refresh
Driver sees update: ❌ Only on manual refresh
```

**After (Event-Driven)**:
```
Admin updates status → Database updated → Events broadcast
                    ↓
    ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
    ↓               ↓               ↓
admin:orders    user:{userId}   delivery:assignments
    ↓               ↓               ↓
All admins     Specific        Assigned driver
see update    customer sees    sees update
instantly     update instantly instantly
```

4. No manual refresh required

### API Testing with Curl

```bash
# Test event broadcasting (requires Supabase setup)
# After updating order status via API, check Supabase Realtime logs

# 1. Update order status
curl -X PUT https://andoid-app-kotlin.vercel.app/api/admin/orders/ORDER_ID/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "confirmed"}'

# Expected: Event broadcasted to admin:orders and user:{customer_id}

# 2. Update inventory
curl -X PUT https://andoid-app-kotlin.vercel.app/api/admin/inventory \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"product_id": "PRODUCT_UUID", "stock": 5, "adjustment_type": "set"}'

# Expected: Event broadcasted to products channel
# Expected: Low stock alert broadcasted to admin:inventory

# 3. Update driver location
curl -X POST https://andoid-app-kotlin.vercel.app/api/delivery/update-location \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer DRIVER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"latitude": 40.7128, "longitude": -74.0060, "order_id": "ORDER_UUID"}'

# Expected: Event broadcasted to driver:{driver_id} and order:{order_id}:tracking
```

## ⚙️ Environment Setup Required

### Supabase Configuration

Ensure these environment variables are set in `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://hfxdxxpmcemdjsvhsdcf.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### Supabase Realtime

The implementation uses Supabase Realtime's **broadcast** feature:
- No additional Supabase configuration needed
- Channels are created on-demand
- No database triggers required (we're using application-level broadcasting)

## 📝 Architecture Decisions

### Why Supabase Realtime over WebSocket Server?

**Chosen**: Supabase Realtime ✅

**Reasons**:
1. Already using Supabase for database
2. Built-in connection management
3. Automatic reconnection and error handling
4. Native PostgreSQL integration (can add DB triggers later)
5. Scales automatically
6. Lower maintenance overhead

**Alternatives Considered**:
- ❌ Custom Socket.io server → More maintenance
- ❌ Server-Sent Events (SSE) → One-way only

### Why Application-Level Broadcasting?

**Current**: Broadcasting in API endpoints ✅

**Alternative**: Database triggers + NOTIFY/LISTEN

**Why Application-Level**:
1. **Easier debugging** - See exactly what events are sent in logs
2. **More control** - Can add business logic before broadcasting
3. **Flexible** - Easy to add/remove events without DB migrations
4. **Faster iteration** - No need to modify database

**Future**: Can add database triggers for critical events later

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Channel Access Control

**Current Implementation**: Open channels (anyone can subscribe)

**Recommendations for Production**:
1. Implement Supabase RLS policies for Realtime channels
2. Use Supabase JWT for channel authentication
3. Filter events based on user roles:
   - `admin:*` channels → Only admin users
   - `user:{userId}` channels → Only that specific user
   - `driver:{driverId}` channels → Only that specific driver

**Example RLS for Realtime** (future implementation):
```sql
-- Only allow users to subscribe to their own channel
CREATE POLICY "Users can subscribe to own channel"
ON realtime.channels
FOR SELECT
USING (
  channel_name = 'user:' || auth.uid()
);
```

### Data Privacy

**Current**: Full order/cart data in events

**Recommendation**: 
- For `products` channel: Only send product_id and stock (no sensitive data)
- For `user:{userId}`: Only send to authenticated user
- For `admin:*`: Only accessible to admin role users

---

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Event Batching

**Current**: Individual broadcasts for each event

**Optimization** (if needed):
```javascript
// Batch multiple events
async function batchBroadcast(events) {
  await Promise.all(
    events.map(event => 
      eventBroadcaster.broadcastToChannel(event.channel, event.type, event.payload)
    )
  )
}
```

### Connection Pooling

**Current**: New channel instance per broadcast

**Already Optimized**: EventBroadcaster uses channel caching (Map)
- Channels are reused once created
- No connection overhead after first use

### Rate Limiting

**Not Implemented**: No rate limiting on events

**Recommendation** (if needed):
- Throttle driver location updates (max 1 per 5 seconds)
- Debounce stock updates from rapid admin changes

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No offline event queue** - Events sent while client offline are lost
   - **Mitigation**: Clients fetch latest state on reconnect

2. **No event ordering guarantee** - Events might arrive out of order
   - **Mitigation**: Add timestamp to payloads, clients handle ordering

3. **No event replay** - Can't retrieve missed events
   - **Mitigation**: Full data fetch on app start/reconnect

4. **No event history** - Events are ephemeral
   - **Mitigation**: If needed, can log events to database separately
